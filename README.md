# Linux-User-Creator
This is a linux script used to create users

Instructions
The script has 2 versions: CentOS and Debian distro. To run either, you must have a c shell installed on your system. You can install csh for Debian, and tcsh for CentOS.  You can verify that you have met this requirement by checking the /etc/shells directory for /bin/csh. Please run the script using sudo command. Many commands in the script require it. By default, the permissions of the script are set that owner, group, and public can execute the script.  The script has been tested on both Debian 10 and CentOS 8 distributions of Linux using Username level one and two text files and functions properly. Please change and make sure you have set the right permissions to run the file as coping the script may incidentally change the permissions.
